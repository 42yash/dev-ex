## 🔥 Risk Register

### Critical Risks
1. **Security vulnerabilities** - Could lead to data breach
   - Mitigation: Immediate security sprint
2. **Memory leaks** - Could cause production outages
   - Mitigation: Implement bounded collections
3. **No testing** - Makes releases unpredictable
   - Mitigation: Mandatory test coverage

### High Risks
1. **Incomplete features** - Blocks MVP release
   - Mitigation: Focus on core features only
2. **Performance issues** - Poor user experience
   - Mitigation: Add monitoring and optimization
3. **Missing documentation** - Slows development
   - Mitigation: Document as we build
