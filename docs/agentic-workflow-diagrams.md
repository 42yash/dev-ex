## Summary

These PlantUML diagrams provide a comprehensive visualization of the Dev-Ex agentic workflow system, covering:

1. **System Architecture**: The overall component structure and relationships
2. **Workflow Phases**: The progression from idea to deployment with checkpoints
3. **Agent Ecosystem**: Dynamic agent creation and collaboration patterns
4. **Widget System**: Interactive UI components replacing text-heavy interfaces
5. **MCP Architecture**: Documentation scraping and knowledge management
6. **Development Orchestration**: How agents coordinate during development
7. **Data Flow**: State management and data persistence patterns
8. **Security & Governance**: Authentication, authorization, and compliance controls

Each diagram illustrates different aspects of the system, showing how autonomous agents collaborate to transform user ideas into fully functional applications while maintaining flexibility for various output types and user control throughout the process.
